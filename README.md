awawa

if you wanna check the validity of a windows 95 key, use [this](https://github.com/MobCat/Windows-95-Product-Key-Check) thing I found

https://github.com/MobCat/Windows-95-Product-Key-Check if that link doesn't work

the C version is really the only one worthwhile to actually compile. if you wanna do that, do `gcc 95keygen.c -o 95keygen` on any major linux distro or WSL. make sure to install the necessary build tools if you don't have them. you can do that on arch by doing `sudo pacman -S base-devel`, or on ubuntu by doing `sudo apt-get install build-essential`. Although if you're looking at compiling this program, you probably already have the necessary tools as this is a REALLY NICHE tool a small amount of people will want, I will admit.
